# MCP Implementation Analysis

This document analyzes the existing MCP (Model-Client-Provider) implementation in the Amazon Q CLI codebase, which was found in the `mcp-enablement-squashed` branch.

## Overview

The MCP implementation in the Amazon Q CLI provides a framework for integrating custom tools through a client-server architecture. This allows for extending the CLI with external tools that can be dynamically loaded and executed.

## Key Components

### 1. MCP Client

The MCP client is implemented in the `mcp_client` crate and provides the core functionality for communicating with MCP servers. Key files include:

- `client.rs`: Implements the client-side communication protocol
- `facilitator_types.rs`: Defines data structures for MCP communication
- `transport/`: Contains implementations for different transport mechanisms

The client uses JSON-RPC over stdio for communication with MCP servers, allowing for bidirectional messaging between the CLI and external tools.

### 2. Custom Tool Integration

The custom tool integration is implemented in `q_chat/src/tools/custom_tool.rs` and provides a bridge between the Amazon Q chat system and external MCP tools. Key features include:

- Tool configuration via a `CustomToolConfig` struct:
  ```rust
  pub struct CustomToolConfig {
      pub command: String,
      pub args: Vec<String>,
      pub env: Option<HashMap<String, String>>,
      pub timeout: u64,
  }
  ```

- Integration with the existing tool system through the `Tool::Custom` variant in the `Tool` enum

### 3. Tool Manager

The `q_chat/src/tool_manager.rs` file implements the management of tools, including custom MCP tools. It handles:

- Tool discovery and registration
- Tool execution and result processing
- Communication with MCP servers

## Architecture

The MCP implementation follows a client-server architecture:

1. **MCP Client**: The Amazon Q CLI acts as a client that communicates with MCP servers
2. **MCP Server**: External processes that implement the MCP protocol and provide tool functionality
3. **JSON-RPC Protocol**: Communication between client and server using JSON-RPC over stdio

## Integration with Chat System

The MCP system integrates with the Amazon Q chat functionality through:

1. **Tool Registration**: Custom tools are registered alongside built-in tools
2. **Tool Execution**: When the model requests a custom tool, the request is forwarded to the appropriate MCP server
3. **Result Processing**: Results from MCP servers are formatted and returned to the model

## Configuration

MCP tools are configured through a configuration system that specifies:

- The command to execute for the MCP server
- Arguments to pass to the server
- Environment variables for the server process
- Timeout settings for tool execution

## Recent Changes

Based on the commit history, recent changes to the MCP implementation include:

- Improved error handling and reporting
- Timeout configuration
- Telemetry for MCP server initialization and tool execution
- Status reporting for MCP server loading
- Validation for MCP server configurations

## Implications for Project Wingman

The existing MCP implementation provides a solid foundation for the tool registry system proposed in Project Wingman. Key points to consider:

1. **Leverage Existing Code**: The MCP client and custom tool integration can be leveraged for the tool registry system
2. **Extend Configuration**: The current configuration can be extended to support the YAML manifest format proposed in Project Wingman
3. **Add Domain Scoping**: The domain-scoped browsing capability can be implemented as an extension to the existing MCP system
4. **Context Integration**: The context graph system will need to be integrated with the existing MCP implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Detailed Code Review**: Conduct a thorough review of the MCP implementation to understand all capabilities and limitations
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify gaps between the existing implementation and Project Wingman requirements
3. **Extension Plan**: Develop a plan for extending the MCP implementation to support Project Wingman features
4. **Integration Strategy**: Define how the context graph and domain-scoped browsing will integrate with the existing MCP system
